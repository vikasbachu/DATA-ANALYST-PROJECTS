# Sales Data Analysis using Python

This project involves analyzing a sales dataset from Kaggle using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal was to uncover key insights about sales performance, product profitability, and regional contributions to revenue.

Project Structure
Dataset: `sales_data.csv` (sourced from Kaggle)
Code: `code.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook)
Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
  - `pandas` (data handling and preprocessing)
  - `numpy` (numerical operations)
  - `matplotlib` (data visualization)
  - `seaborn` (enhanced visualizations)
